# MPLAB® Harmony 3 Reference Applications for SAM MCUs

MPLAB® Harmony 3 is an extension of the MPLAB® ecosystem for creating embedded firmware solutions for Microchip 32-bit SAM and PIC® microcontroller and microprocessor devices.  Refer to the following links for more information.

- [Microchip 32-bit MCUs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit)
- [Microchip 32-bit MPUs](https://www.microchip.com/design-centers/32-bit-mpus)

- [Microchip MPLAB® Harmony Pages](https://microchip-mplab-harmony.github.io/)

This repository contains the MPLAB® Harmony 3 Reference Applications for SAM MCUs.

Reference Applications for SAM MCUs are standalone applications which demonstrates specific features or capabilities of Microchip SAM MCUs. These applications are developed on Microchip's SAM MCU development boards/kits.

In addition to having the MCU, the SAM MCU development boards/kits
also provide support to exercise the features of MCU through extension hardware
like displays, communication buses, transceivers, sensors, external memories, etc.
The additional hardware features are available on the SAM MCU development boards/kits
or is available as plugin through interface headers like mikroBUS Click or Xplained Pro extensions.

Following are the typical application types in this repository
- Large feature-rich applications involving integration of several technologies like USB, TCP/IP, Wireless, Security, Low Power, RTOS, etc.
- Applications demonstrating certain capabilities of the SAM MCUs. For example: Low Power applications, etc.
- Applications demonstrating capabilities of Microchip SAM MCU development boards/kits (Curiosity, Nano, etc.) which allows extending hardware capability through mikroBUS Click or Xplained Pro extensions.
- Getting started applications pertaining to the SAM MCU products. These getting started applications demonstrates usage of MPLAB Harmony 3 framework with MCC UI by exercising commonly used peripheral features.

The above application types serve as a reference source to evaluate solutions for PIC32CM MCUs by developing applications using MPLAB Harmony 3 software framework.  

### Note:
- The application examples in this repository are an alternative source of reference covering the above types. MPLAB Harmony 3 provides more product-specific examples on peripherals, drivers and middleware technologies. More such examples are available in the product/technology-specific repositories.
- Refer the MPLAB Harmony 3 GitHub [Launch page](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony) to view the complete list of MPLAB Harmony 3 packages. In each of these packages refer the underlying “apps” folder for the applications offering.
