## Software/Tools Used:
<span style="color:blue"> This project has been verified to work with the following versions of software tools:</span>  

Refer [Project Manifest](./firmware/src/config/sam_e51_cnano/harmony-manifest-success.yml) present in harmony-manifest-success.yml under the project folder *firmware/src/config/sam_e51_cnano*  
- Refer the [Release Notes](../../../../release_notes.md#microchip-mplab-harmony-3-release-notes) to know the **MPLAB X IDE** and **MCC** Plugin version. Alternatively, [Click Here](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/blob/master/release_notes.md#microchip-mplab-harmony-3-release-notes).

<span style="color:blue"> Because Microchip regularly update tools, occasionally issue(s) could be discovered while using the newer versions of the tools. If the project doesnâ€™t seem to work and version incompatibility is suspected, It is recommended to double-check and use the same versions that the project was tested with. </span> To download original version of MPLAB Harmony v3 packages, refer to document [How to Use the MPLAB Harmony v3 Project Manifest Feature](https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/How-to-Use-the-MPLAB-Harmony-v3-Project-Manifest-Feature-DS90003305.pdf)

## Setup:
- Connect Mikroe Flash 2 Click and SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit to the Curiosity Nano Base Board.
- Connect the SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit to the Host PC as a USB Device through a Type-A male to micro-B USB cable connected to Micro-B USB (Debug USB) port.

## Programming hex file:
The pre-built hex file can be programmed by following the below steps.  

### Steps to program the hex file
- Open MPLAB X IDE
- Close all existing projects in IDE, if any project is opened.
- Go to File -> Import -> Hex/ELF File
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 1 - Create Prebuilt Project, Click the "Browse" button to select the prebuilt hex file.
- Select Device has "ATSAME51J20A"
- Ensure the proper tool is selected under "Hardware Tool"
- Click on Next button
- In the "Import Image File" window, Step 2 - Select Project Name and Folder, select appropriate project name and folder
- Click on Finish button
- In MPLAB X IDE, click on "Make and Program Device" Button. The device gets programmed in sometime
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below


## Programming/Debugging Application Project:
- Open the project (flash_2/firmware/sam_e51_cnano.X) in MPLAB X IDE
- Ensure "SAM E51 Curiosity Nano" is selected as hardware tool to program/debug the application
- Build the code and program the device by clicking on the "make and program" button in MPLAB X IDE tool bar
- Follow the steps in "Running the Demo" section below

## Running the Demo:
- Reset the device by power cycle
- LED0 is turned ON when the data read from SST26 flash matches with the data written using SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit

## Instructions to add Flash 2 Click functionality to your application:

You could use this demonstration as an example to add Flash 2 Click functionality to your MPLAB Harmony v3 based application. Follow the below steps.  
1. If you haven't downloaded the Flash 2 Click demo yet [Click Here](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/reference_apps/releases/latest/download/flash_2.zip) to download, otherwise go to next step
2. Unzip the downloaded .zip file  
3. From the unzipped folder flash_2/firmware/src, copy the folder **click_routines** to the folder firmware/src under your MPLAB Harmony v3 application project  
4. Open MPLAB X IDE  
5. Open your application project  
6. In the project explorer, Right click on folder **Header Files**  
   and add a sub folder **click_routines** by selecting "Add Existing Items from Folders..."  
	 <img src = "images/header_add.png">  

- Click on "Add Folder..." button  
	<img src = "images/header_add2.png">  

- Select the "click_routines" folder and select "Files of Types" as Header Files  
	<img src = "images/header_add3.png">

- Click on "Add" button to add the selected folder  
	<img src = "images/header_add4.png">

- The Flash 2 Click example header files gets added to your project  
	<img src = "images/header_add5.png">

7. In the project explorer, Right click on folder **Source Files**  
   and add a sub folder **click_routines** by selecting "Add Existing Items from Folders..."   
	 <img src = "images/source_add.png">  

 - Click on "Add Folder..." button  
 	<img src = "images/source_add2.png">  

 - Select the "click_routines" folder and select "Files of Types" as Source Files  
 	<img src = "images/source_add3.png">

 - Click on "Add" button to add the selected folder  
 	<img src = "images/source_add4.png">

 - The Flash 2 Click example source files gets added to your project  
 	<img src = "images/source_add5.png">

8. The Flash 2 Click example uses the **SPI**, **SST26 Driver**, **USART** peripherals and **PORT** pins . The configuration of these peripherals for your application depends on the 32-bit MCU and development board you are using.

	- **Configure SPI**:
 		- Add the SERCOM peripheral block to the MCC project graph  
		- Configure SPI Pins using MCC Pin configuration Window  
		The SPI configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU
 			- 32-bit MCU development board
 			- The socket on which you have mounted the Flash 2 Click board  
 		*Example: The Flash 2 Click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards to mount the Flash 2 Click board. The SPI lines from MCU coming to this socket are from the SERCOM1 peripheral on the MCU.*  
		
		*MCC Project Graph - SPI configuration*  
		<img src = "images/spi_config.png">  

		*MCC Pin Configurator - SPI pin configuration*  
		<img src = "images/spi_pins.png"> 

	- **Configure USART**:
 		- Add the SERCOM peripheral block to the MCC project graph  
		- Configure USART Pins using MCC Pin configuration Window  
		The USART configuration depends on
 			- 32-bit MCU
 			- 32-bit MCU development board
 			- The socket on which you have mounted the Flash 2 Click board  
 		*Example: The Flash 2 Click example on SAM E51 Curiosity Nano Evaluation Kit uses mikroBUS socket #1 on the Curiosity Nano Base for Click boards to mount the Flash 2 Click board. The USART lines from MCU coming to this socket are from the SERCOM1 peripheral on the MCU.*  
		
		*MCC Project Graph - USART configuration*  
		<img src = "images/usart.png">  

		*MCC Pin Configurator - USART pin configuration*  
		<img src = "images/usart_pins.png"> 

    - **Configure SST26 Driver**:
 		- Add the SST26 Driver peripheral block to the MCC project graph  
		- Connect SERCOM 1 to SST26 Driver block
		  
		*MCC Project Graph - SST26 configuration*
		<img src = "images/sst26_config.png">
    - **Configure BSP**:
		- Add the SAM E51 Curiosity Nano BSP (Board Support packages)   
		<img src = "images/bsp.png">   
        
    - **Configure Core**:
		- Add the Core block to the MCC project graph 
		*MCC Project Graph - Core configuration*  
		<img src = "images/core.png">
        
9. The **click_routines** folder contain an example C source file **flash_2_example.c**. You could use **flash_2_example.c** as a reference to add Flash 2 Click functionality to your application.
